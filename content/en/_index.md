SpinKube combines the <a href="https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator">Spin operator</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/spinkube/containerd-shim-spin">containerd shim Spin</a>, and the <a
href="https://github.com/spinkube/runtime-class-manager">runtime class manager</a> (formerly <a
href="https://kwasm.sh/">KWasm</a>) open source projects with contributions from Microsoft, SUSE,
Liquid Reply, and Fermyon. By running applications at the Wasm abstraction layer, SpinKube gives
developers a more powerful, efficient and scalable way to optimize application delivery on
Kubernetes.

### Overview

[**Spin Operator**](https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/) is a Kubernetes operator that enables
deploying and running Spin applications in Kubernetes. It houses the SpinApp and SpinAppExecutor CRDs
which are used for configuring the individual workloads and workload execution configuration such as
runtime class. Spin Operator introduces a host of functionality such as resource-based scaling,
event-driven scaling and much more.

[**Containerd Shim Spin**](https://github.com/spinkube/containerd-shim-spin) provides a shim for running Spin
workloads managed by containerd. The Spin workload uses this shim as a runtime class within Kubernetes enabling
these workloads to function similarly to container workloads in Pods in Kubernetes.

[**Runtime Class Manager**](https://github.com/spinkube/runtime-class-manager) is an operator that
automates and manages the lifecycle of containerd shims in a Kubernetes environment. This includes tasks
like installation, update, removal, and configuration of shims, reducing manual errors and improving
reliability in managing WebAssembly (Wasm) workloads and other containerd extensions.

[**Spin Kube Plugin**](https://github.com/spinkube/spin-plugin-kube) is a plugin for the [Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v3/index) CLI
that aims to ease the experience for scaffolding, deploying and inspecting Spin workloads in Kubernetes.

### Get Involved

We have bi-weekly [community calls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10is2YoNC0NpXw4_5lSyTfpPph9_A9wBissKGrpFaIrI/edit?usp=sharing) and a [Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C06PC7JA1EE). We would love to have you join us! <br>
