# Quickstart

This Quickstart guide demonstrates how to set up a new Kubernetes cluster, install the Spin Operator and deploy your first Spin application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure necessary [prerequisites]({{< ref "prerequisites" >}}) are installed.


For this Quickstart in particular, you will need:

- [kubectl]({{< ref "prerequisites#kubectl" >}}) - the Kubernetes CLI
- [k3d]({{< ref "prerequisites#k3d" >}}) - a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that runs on Docker
- [Docker]({{< ref "prerequisites#docker" >}}) - for running k3d

Also, ensure you have cloned this repository and have navigated to the root of the project:

```console
git clone git@github.com:spinkube/spin-operator.git
cd spin-operator
```

### Set up Your Kubernetes Cluster

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster with a k3d image that includes the [containerd-shim-spin](https://github.com/spinkube/containerd-shim-spin) prerequisite already installed:

<!-- TODO: update below with ghcr.io/spinkube/containerd-shim-spin/k3d:<tag> -->

```console
k3d cluster create wasm-cluster \
  --image ghcr.io/deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims/examples/k3d:v0.11.0 \
  --port "8081:80@loadbalancer" \
  --agents 2
```

> Note: Spin Operator requires a few Kubernetes resources that are installed globally to the cluster. We create these directly through `kubectl` as a best practice, since their lifetimes are usually managed separately from a given Spin Operator installation.

> > For now our quickstart relies on `make` tasks within the repository. We will provide Kustomize and Helm instructions in the future.

2. Install cert manager

```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.14.2/cert-manager.yaml
```

3. Apply the [Runtime Class](https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/blob/main/config/samples/spin-runtime-class.yaml) used for scheduling Spin apps onto nodes running the shim:

> Note: In a production cluster you likely want to customize the runtimeClass with a `nodeSelector:` that matches nodes that have the shim installed. In the K3D example they're installed on every node. 

```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/v0.0.1/spin-operator.runtime-class.yaml
```

4. Apply the [Custom Resource Definitions](../../glossary#custom-resource-definition-crd) used by the Spin Operator:


```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/v0.0.1/spin-operator.crds.yaml
```

## Deploy the Spin Operator

Run the following command to run the Spin Operator locally. This will create all of the Kubernetes resources required by Spin Operator under the Kubernetes namespace spin-operator. It may take a moment for the installation to complete as dependencies are installed and pods are spinning up.

```console
make docker-build IMG=ghcr.io/spinkube/spin-operator:dev
k3d image import -c wasm-cluster ghcr.io/spinkube/spin-operator:dev
make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/spinkube/spin-operator:dev
```

Lastly, create the shim executor:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/releases/download/v0.0.1/spin-operator.shim-executor.yaml
```

## Run the Sample Application

You are now ready to deploy Spin applications onto the cluster!

1. Create your first application in the same `spin-operator` namespace that the operator is running:

```console
kubectl apply -f config/samples/simple.yaml
```

2. Forward a local port to the application pod so that it can be reached:

```console
kubectl port-forward svc/simple-spinapp 8083:80
```

3. In a different terminal window, make a request to the application:

```console
curl localhost:8083/hello
```

You should see:

```bash
Hello world from Spin!
```

## Next Steps

Congrats on deploying your first SpinApp! Recommended next steps:

- Scale your [Spin Apps with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)]({{< ref "scaling-with-hpa.md" >}})
- Scale your [Spin Apps with Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA)]({{< ref "scaling-with-keda.md" >}})
